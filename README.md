## Projects

[Speech Emotion Recognition](https://github.com/m-djawadi/SER)
Audio feature extraction and data augmentation techniques were utilized for sentiment classification using NLP-based ML models, including XGboost, CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and Wav2Vec.

[Sentiment Classification](https://github.com/m-djawadi/Twitter_OnlineLearning)
Tweets on online learning were scraped using Tweepy and underwent comprehensive preprocessing for text normalization and noise removal. Sentiment labels were assigned using TextBlob, and a classification model was trained on the labeled data. 

[Recommendation System ](https://github.com/m-djawadi/Recom_Sys)
Explored deep learning and recommender models, including NeuMF, Wide and Deep, DeepFM, and improved DIN, in various datasets. 

[Text Classification](https://github.com/m-djawadi/Txt_classification)
Predicted subject categories of scientific research papers based on abstracts using LSTM, BERT, and RoBERTa models. Applied thorough text cleaning techniques for normalization and noise removal.
